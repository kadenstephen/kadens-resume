        <h2>Who? </h2>
        <p>Kaden Stephen is a first year student at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, with hopes to soon enter the BYU Marriott School of Business to receive his degree in Finance. 
            Currently, Kaden also teaches leadership, social, and language skills at the Provo Missionary Training Center. He is originally from South Orange County, CA, and graduated from 
            San Clemente High School with a 4.5 GPA, a Seal of Biliteracy in Spanish, and a varsity letter for running Track & Field. Upon graduation in 2019, Kaden lived for two years across a 
            number of Pacific islands including Kiribati, Fiji, and Hawaii, where he became fluent in the Kiribati language and performed service as a missionary for island locals in junction with his church. 
            While there, he was placed as a leader over the other 100 missionaries, teaching him valuable leadership skills, and an increased understanding of different cultures. He has also interned at Mixtech, 
            an engineering company based in Salt Lake, and worked at retail shops around Orange County.
